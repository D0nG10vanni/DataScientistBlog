### "Predicting Ancient Roman Monuments"

This analysis has been conducted in the context of the Udacity Nanodegree "Data Scientist".
The sources for the data gathered can be downloaded as .csv in this repository. The file is called "Sources".

### Motivation
I wanted to identify a way to somewhat reliably predict the amount of ancient roman monuments based on the cities per province and country.

### Libraries used
SciKit Learn, Matplotlib, numpy and pandas

### Description of files
1. Sources.csv: This is the base for the analysis
2. Analysis.ipynb: This is the script which was used to conduct the analysis

### Results
I was able to create a pretty accurate model (RÂ² = 0.93)
