### "Predicting Ancient Roman Monuments"

This analysis has been conducted in the context of the Udacity Nanodegree "Data Scientist".
The sources for the data gathered can be downloaded as .csv in this repository. The file is called "Sources".

### Motivation
#### Description
We are supporting a research team looking for new evidence to better outline the roman civilization chronicles. Wen then want to rent the found antiquities to local museums for them to put on display.

##### Question 1:
Which region has the highest count of ancient roman monuments?

##### Question 2:
How are cities and monuments related to each other?

##### Question 3:
Which of the three regions chosen by our research team (Gallia Lugdunensis, Moesia Inferior, Bithynia et Pontus) should be selected for their exploration? We want the highest probability of finding new monuments.

### Libraries used
SciKit Learn, Matplotlib, numpy and pandas
